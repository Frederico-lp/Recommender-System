I went through hell trying to uninstall the expired version in order to install the new.  I called Webroot and had their representative remote into my computer at his request. He was clueless as a bad joke and consumed 29 minutes and 57 seconds of my time forever.  He initially told me it wasn't compatible with Windows 10, but I finally managed to convince him that it is indeed compatible with Windows 10 as it was working on my computer before it expired and also I showed him a review on Amazon to convince him that it works on Windows 10. Finally, he offered to connect me with a senior consultant for over 100 dollars. I declined and told him I'd fix the issue myself. This guy was less helpful than a severed limb.  After spending some time on Google, the issue is now fixed. Webroot should just get rid of their customer service and pay Google for indexing much more helpful info that their dedicated customer service can offer.  As far as the software itself. I think it scans fast, does not slow down my computer and I hope (like most other people including experts) that it's very effective in removing and preventing malware.  Years ago I did extensive research and found it to be among the best, but that was over 4 years ago. Things are fluid in the malware kingdom.  To those experiencing the same issue installing as I did - My advice - don't bother uninstalling the old version, rather launch webroot and click on  &#34;my account&#34; on the right side, then copy and past your product key in the area that says &#34;enter a new keycode&#34;, then click on Activate. This will save numerous painful hours of trying to get the thing to work.\", \"EXCELLENT software !!!!!  Don't need to do anything when it's set up in automatic mode. Noticed a big difference after the first scan/tests\", \"The variations created by Win10 induced this program to eat every bit of work up to that time. All of it, hundreds of hours of work. Guess who's unhappy.\", \"Horrible!  Would not upgrade previous version files and when I gave up on that and figured I'd just move forward it wouldn't let me log in, even after numerous creations of a new account, trying an existing account.  Very frustrating.  I returned it.\", 'Waste of time .', 'Work as easy as other tools that I have used.']\n"
